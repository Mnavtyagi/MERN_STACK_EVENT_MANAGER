  <p>
    Welcome to our Event Management website, a platform built with precision and care using the MERN stack. I’m Manav Tyagi, the developer behind this project, and I’ve created this website to streamline the way events are planned, managed, and executed.

    With a passion for technology and a deep understanding of event management, I set out to create a solution that caters to both organizers and participants. The front-end is powered by React, ensuring a smooth, responsive, and user-friendly experience. Whether you're planning a small gathering or a large conference, our platform is designed to meet your needs.

    Our system allows you to effortlessly create and manage events, track RSVPs, and communicate with attendees. The robust backend, built with Node.js and Express, ensures that all data is securely handled and efficiently processed. MongoDB, our database of choice, provides a scalable and flexible solution for storing all the essential information related to your events.

    As the sole developer, I’ve focused on creating a seamless experience, combining functionality with an intuitive design. This platform is not just a tool but a complete solution that empowers users to bring their events to life with ease.

    Thank you for choosing our platform. We’re here to make your event management experience as efficient and stress-free as possible.
